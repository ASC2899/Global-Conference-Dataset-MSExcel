## Solutions and Approach
To find the solutions for all the questions asked in the dataset of 3 sheets, 9 Questions. Then, using those solution get insights and finally craft a dashboard. **If you're practicing with same dataset and found yourself confused solving these Qs then my friend, I got you.**

The approach was simple to this Q, we've been given Lookup Values(Attendee ID) and with the help of Vlookup you can find all rhe info of each Attendee asked in this Q.

## Q2. The management seeks insights into the distribution of attendees across different Tech Fields represented at the conference. Understanding this distribution will help in tailoring future events to cater to specific interests and trends within the tech community. You need to calculate the total number of attendees for each Tech Field and then create a labelled bar chart for it, sorted in descending order.


## Q3. Identifying the most and least popular speakers is crucial for understanding attendee preferences. By examining the number of attendees for each speaker, you can determine which sessions attracted the highest and lowest participation rates, thereby informing decisions for future speaker selection. For the speaker with maximum number of attendees and minimun number of attendes, you need to find the values for the below provided columns. Also, write your approach to get the solution.


## Q4. Analyzing attendee demographics by country and tech field provides valuable insights into the global reach of the conference and the popularity of different tech fields in various regions. This information is essential for planning targeted marketing campaigns and expanding the conference's international presence. You need to calculate the total number of attendees from each country, for each Tech Field.


## Q5. For a deeper understanding of attendee engagement with specific speakers, you're tasked with compiling a list of attendees who attended sessions led by Speaker "SPK032". This information will help in assessing the impact and appeal of individual speakers among conference attendees.

This analysis aids in identifying key target audiences and tailoring content to meet their specific needs and interests. You need to calculate the number of attendees for each occupation. Also give Rank to each occupation by their popularity (eg. Rank 1 to tech field with maximum number of attendees and so on).


## Q7. Identifying attendees who registered on a particular date offers insights into registration trends and the effectiveness of marketing efforts at different stages of event promotion. This information informs future registration strategies and resource allocation for promotional activities.

## Q8. Examining the distribution of speakers and sessions across different countries provides insights into the global diversity of conference content and the geographical reach of the event. This analysis informs decisions regarding speaker recruitment and session planning to ensure broad representation and appeal. You need to calculate total number of speakers for each country and total number of sessions they conducted and then create a labelled column chart for it.


## Q9. Creating a column chart to visualize the distribution of experience levels within each tech field enables stakeholders to easily grasp the demographics of attendees in relation to their professional backgrounds. This visualization aids in identifying trends and opportunities for targeted engagement strategies. Create a Column Chart visualization to show the distribution of experience level in each tech field.
